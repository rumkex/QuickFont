Overview
========

This is a fork of OpenTK QuickFont project. The main difference is that it is aimed to 
be renderer-agnostic: QuickFont just produces a list of quads to be rendered in any way 
the user wishes. For basic image and font manipulations QuickFont uses System.Drawing.

Sample project can be found [here](https://github.com/ambient92/QuickFont-Examples)
